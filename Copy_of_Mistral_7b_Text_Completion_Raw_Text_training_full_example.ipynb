Born on 28 July 1988\\nin Pretoria, South Africa, to a family deeply rooted in Dutch traditions, Lea's early life was infused with a blend of\\nSouth African resilience and Dutch pragmatism, shaping her into a global citizen from a young age.\\n\\nLea's academic accomplishments are notable, with an Honours degree in Psychology from the University of South Africa,\\nhighlighting her dedication to understanding human behavior and providing psychological support. Her qualifications,\\nrecognized equivalent to a bachelor's degree in psychology in the Dutch education system by Nuffic evaluation, reinforce\\nher preparedness for meaningful contributions in her field.\\n\\nProfessionally, Lea has demonstrated a strong commitment to helping others, evident in her roles within the healthcare\\nsector as a pharmacist assistant and in education as a teacher in Asia. These experiences not only honed her skills in\\npatient care and education but also deepened her understanding and empathy towards diverse communities. Her journey of\\npersonal and professional development was further navigated with Marjo's unwavering support, embarking together on\\nadventures to Thailand, Laos, and China, marking significant milestones in both their careers and personal lives.\\n\\nLea's narrative is further enriched through a profound exploration of her heritage, a journey intertwined with Marjo's\\ndedication to unveiling her familial ties through extensive DNA research. Their collective effort culminated in\\nrekindling connections with her biological father, Johan Storbeck, and meeting her half-sister, Chrissie, which not only\\npainted a fuller picture of her ancestry but also opened new chapters of belonging and self-discovery.\\n\\nHer marriage to Marjo Wenzel van Lier and their shared voyages speak volumes of their unified spirit to explore and\\ngrow, shaping decisions such as relocating to the Netherlands for stability, family ties, and a promising future for\\ntheir son, Nicholas (Nico) Wenzel van Lier.\\n\\nFacing health challenges like Type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis with grace, Lea's resilience further\\nexemplifies her profound strength.

It was amidst this fusion of art and music that Nadia, Marjo's then-girlfriend,\\nunwittingly played the role of cupid. With a casual gesture, Nadia directed Marjo's attention to Lea, a figure exuding\\nan unmistakable allure and radiant beauty amidst the crowd. Struck by an immediate and powerful connection to Lea, Marjo\\nfound himself at a crossroads. Confronted by the depth of his feelings, he made the difficult but defining decision to\\nend the relationship with Nadia that very day. This choice marked the commencement of an extraordinary journey with Lea,\\none that transcended the fleeting moments of the festival and ventured into a shared lifetime of love, discovery, and\\nmutual growth.\\n\\n## Early Relationship and Adventure in Thailand\\n\\nThe romance blossomed into a profound connection soon after Marjo and Lea started dating on 6 June 2014. The initial\\nstages of their relationship were characterized by shared dreams and an unquenchable thirst for adventure. These early\\ndays laid the foundation for a decision that would drastically change their lives: moving to Thailand to teach English.\\nEncased in excitement and a bit of apprehension, they packed their lives into suitcases and embarked on their journey\\nfrom Johannesburg to Bangkok on 24 October 2014, a date that marked not only a geographic shift but also a pivotal leap\\nin their commitment to each other.\\n\\nThailand offered a canvas for aspirations. A quick adaptation to the new life occurred, immersing in the culture and\\ncommunity. The challenge of teaching English in a foreign land drew closer, as navigation through the complexities of a\\nnew job and the subtleties of each other's personalities in a different setting was required. It was here, within the\\nclassroom walls and the scenic beauty of Thailand, that the strength of partnership and the depth of love were\\ndiscovered.\\n\\nThis time in Thailand was more than just an adventure; it was a testament to resilience and harmony as a couple. It\\nrepresented shared values of exploration, learning, and the desire to make a meaningful impact. This period in life was\\nnot just about teaching English; it was about learning the most important lesson of all - that together, any challenge\\ncould be faced and any journey embarked upon.\\n\\n## Adventure in Thailand, Laos, and China\\n\\nTheir journey abroad took on exciting new dimensions as they ventured from Thailand to Laos, and ultimately to China,\\nmarking significant milestones in both their professional careers and personal lives.\\n\\nIn Thailand, their adventure began earnestly with them completing their rigorous TESOL training, receiving their\\ncertifications on 20 October 2014. This training, accredited by OTTSA, equipped them with the necessary skills for\\nteaching English, including lesson planning, classroom management, and engaging diverse learners. It was a foundational\\nstep preparing them for the teaching challenges that awaited them ahead.\\n\\nMoving on to Laos, they found themselves at the Eastern Star Bilingual School in Vientiane from November 2014 to\\nMarch 2015. This was their first professional teaching experience abroad, offering both challenges and rewards as they\\nnavigated a new educational system and cultural environment. It was a period of rapid growth, learning, and adaptation,\\nwhich saw them forming meaningful connections with their students and colleagues alike.\\n\\nThe next chapter of their adventure unfolded in Beijing, China, where Lea secured a teaching position at First Leap.\\nThis role was not just another job; it was a significant step up in her teaching career, allowing her to apply and\\nexpand upon the skills gained from their previous experiences. Meanwhile, Marjo supported her journey, living in Beijing\\non a tourist visa. However, their plans encountered a setback when Marjo's visa was rejected by the Hong Kong\\nauthorities, necessitating his premature return to South Africa. This unforeseen hurdle plunged them into a\\nlong-distance relationship, testing their resilience and commitment. Despite the physical distance, this phase allowed\\nLea to excel in her role at First Leap, further developing her expertise and passion for teaching. Meanwhile, their\\nrelationship grew stronger, demonstrating that love and dedication can bridge even the longest distances.\\n\\n## Building a Life Together in South Africa\\n\\nLea's return to South Africa on 16 February 2016 marked a poignant moment in their journey, bringing to a close their\\nadventures abroad and commencing a new chapter on home soil. Her flight from Beijing to Johannesburg was not just a\\nreturn; it was a bridge to their future together, carrying the wealth of experiences and personal growth gained from\\ntheir time in Asia to weave into the fabric of their life in South Africa.\\n\\nUpon Lea's return, they embarked on creating their shared life by establishing their first home together at Rocky View,\\nlocated at 770 Windsurf Street, Weltevredenpark. Starting from early March 2016, this place became the canvas for their\\ndreams, filled with love, learning, and countless shared experiences. Their tenure at Rocky View represented a\\nsignificant period of growth and adaptation, as they forged their paths together, navigating the intricacies of a life\\nintertwined.\\n\\nAs they evolved together, so did their aspirations for the space they inhabited. Seeking a new environment that mirrored\\ntheir growth and the changes in their lives, they decided to move to Woodridge Place. On 16 August 2019, they took a\\nsignificant step in their journey by relocating to this tranquil complex at 60 Ouhout Avenue, Weltevredenpark, 1709.\\nThis transition was more than a mere change of address; it was a milestone that epitomized their evolving dreams and\\naspirations.\\n\\nIn Woodridge Place, their bond continued to deepen, paving the way for new memories and experiences. This home became a\\ntestament to the resilience, love, and shared vision that characterize their relationship. Each corner of Woodridge\\nPlace is infused with the essence of their adventures, dreams, and the life they have built together, standing as a\\nbeacon of their love and the limitless possibilities that their future holds.\\n\\n## A Proposal That Marked Their Future\\n\\nOne of the most significant moments in their journey together unfolded on 16 December 2018, set against the backdrop of\\nBiru, a Chinese hotpot restaurant nestled in the vibrant heart of Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa. This evening was\\nnot merely another date; it was a carefully curated convergence of love, anticipation, and shared dreams, all\\nunbeknownst to Lea.\\n\\nAmidst the simmering hotpot and the restaurant's cosy ambience, Marjo found the perfect moment to reach for Lea's hand,\\npoised to ask the most pivotal question of their lives. Linda, Lea's mother, was there in person, her presence adding a\\ntangible layer of familial warmth to this significant milestone. To ensure this milestone was captured with the same\\nauthenticity and spontaneous joy that marked the beginning of their journey, they had a discreet photographer\\ndocumenting the event. This was a thoughtful echo of how they first met at the Jacaranda Day music festival, where\\nmoments of genuine emotion and surprise were captured without their immediate awareness.\\n\\nWith everything in place, Marjo proposed to Lea, enveloping them in the love and anticipation of a shared future. Her\\njoyous acceptance was a beautiful affirmation of their bond, observed by her mother and immortalised through the hidden\\nphotographer's lens. This proposal did not just signify the start of their commitment to a life together; it celebrated\\nthe path that had led them to this defining moment.\\n\\nTheir engagement, beautifully documented, serves as a vivid testament to the love, shared values, and adventurous spirit\\nthat form the foundation of their relationship. The physical presence of Linda and the visual records by the hidden\\nphotographer have added an extra layer of significance to the occasion, ensuring they remember it not just as a mere\\npersonal commitment to each other but as a celebration shared with those who have nurtured and supported their passage.\\n\\n## Pet Names and Affectionate Moments\\n\\nThroughout their relationship, they have lovingly used various pet names for each other, each encapsulating moments of\\naffection, playfulness, and deep emotional connection. These names serve as a testament to the joy and intimacy that\\ndefine their bond:\\n\\n- **Bekkie**, a term that often finds its way into their everyday expressions of gratitude and love.\\n\\n- **Vlooitjie** (little flea), symbolizing the small, yet significantly impactful moments of care and playful affection\\n  in their relationship.\\n\\n- **Nooitjie**, embodying the moments of surprise and delight they share, whether in celebration of personal\\n  achievements or the simple joys of life.\\n\\n- **Bokkalops**, a playful yet affectionate nickname that speaks to the unique and quirky aspects of their love for one\\n  another.\\n\\n- **Troskie**, reflecting the strength and support they provide to each other, symbolizing their unity and shared\\n  resilience in facing life‚Äôs challenges.\\n\\n- **Parravis**, a rare but deeply meaningful term, showcasing the personalized and intimate layer of their relationship,\\n  filled with private jokes and shared laughter.\\n\\n- **Tossie**, emerges in their exchanges as a playful tease, encapsulating the light-hearted and joyful aspects of their\\n  daily interactions, enriching their communication with laughter and happiness.\\n\\n- **Flossie**, akin to Tossie, is imbued with affection and playfulness. Used in moments of casual intimacy, it\\n  reinforces the tender, carefree essence of their bond, symbolizing those priceless, joy-filled interactions that\\n  define them.\\n\\nThese affectionate nicknames weave a tapestry of love and playfulness, portraying the depth of their relationship. Each\\nterm is more than a simple nickname; it is a reflection of shared experiences, moments of joy, and the enduring love\\nthat fuels their journey together.\\n\\n## Nico Wenzel van Lier - Their Shining Star\\n\\nOur lives were irrevocably changed with the arrival of our beloved son, Nicholas Wenzel van Lier, affectionately called\\nNico, on the sunny afternoon of 8 September 2021, in Roodepoort, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa. Born at precisely\\n14:00 SAST, Nico brought a new era of happiness, love, and limitless joy into our world. His birth not only heralded the\\nstart of our journey into parenthood but also deepened our bonds, teaching us the profound essence of unconditional\\nlove.\\n\\nWith striking blue eyes that reflect the depth of the sky and vibrant ginger hair that captures the glow of a setting\\nsun, Nico is a breathtaking blend of unique traits that further endear him to all who meet him. His distinctive\\nappearance, combined with his joyful and explorative nature, makes each day with him a journey into beauty and wonder.\\n\\n### The Conception of Our Son\\n\\nThe journey to our son's arrival was marked by a series of intimate nights where candlelight painted the ambiance, not\\ndue to external situations like loadshedding but as a choice reflecting our deep desire and readiness to start a family.\\nThese nights, enveloped in love and hope, were the emotional and spiritual groundwork for the beginning of Nico's\\njourney into our lives. They were moments of profound connection and alignment, setting the stage for the incredible\\njourney that lay ahead of us.\\n\\n### A Box Full of Hopes and Dreams\\n\\nThe revelation that we were going to become parents was uniquely special. Lea chose a deeply personal and memorable way\\nto share the news with me. She prepared a box, lovingly filled with tiny baby clothes, a heartwarming card playfully\\nnoting that it wasn‚Äôt just PMS, and the positive pregnancy test. This thoughtful presentation was not just about the\\nnews itself, but also about the journey we were about to embark on together. It was a profoundly touching and\\nlife-changing moment, symbolizing the transition from being a couple to becoming a family. This creative and loving\\nmethod of sharing such joyous news set the tone for our journey into parenthood‚Äîa journey filled with love,\\nanticipation, and the shared joy of awaiting the arrival of our beloved Nico.\\n\\n### Discovering Joy Every Day\\n\\nEvery day with Nico is an odyssey of discovery and awe. From his first giggle to his first independent steps, each\\nmilestone is a festivity, underscoring the marvel of growth and the limitless potentials he embodies. His inquisitive\\nnature and zest for exploring his surroundings remind us daily of the magnificence found in life's simplest aspects,\\nviewed through the fresh, unjaded eyes of a child.\\n\\n### Evolution and Growth\\n\\nAs Nico matures, so do his interests and affections. His once inseparable attachment to childhood comforts has evolved\\ninto fond memories as he embraces new phases of his growth. This transition symbolizes not just physical growth but also\\nthe natural progression of emotional and cognitive development. It's a poignant reminder of the transient nature of\\nchildhood and the diverse joys and challenges each stage presents.\\n\\n### Looking to the Future\\n\\nOur dreams for Nico are as limitless as the sky. We envision a future where he continues to flourish, discover, and\\ncarve his own path, all while imbued with the values we hold dear. Our journey with him is one of continuous learning,\\nlaughter, and love as we navigate the exciting and unpredictable waters of parenthood, guiding him and being guided by\\nthe light he brings into our existence.\\n\\nNico, just a nickname to some, but to us, he is the brightest constellation in our universe, a ceaseless source of\\nlight, love, and joy. We eagerly look forward to each new day, every discovery with him, treasuring our journey together\\nas a family.\\n\\n## The Decision to Move to the Netherlands\\n\\nThe tumultuous events of the 2021 South African unrest, sparked by the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma,\\nbecame a pivotal turning point for us. As South Africa grappled with its worst violence since the end of Apartheid, we\\nfound our lives caught in a maelstrom of socio-political chaos. From 9 to 18 July, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces\\nwere thrust into turmoil, witnessing widespread looting, arson, and a tragic toll of 354 lives lost.\\n\\nThe unrest hit too close to home, particularly affecting regions like Cresta and Randridge ‚Äî areas woven into the fabric\\nof our daily lives. Such direct exposure left us feeling profoundly vulnerable and deeply concerned for our family's\\nsafety, particularly for our son, Nico. The crisis underscored the fragility of socio-economic stability and heightened\\nour apprehensions about Nico‚Äôs future in an increasingly volatile landscape.\\n\\nThe discord went beyond mere political upheaval; it illuminated the acute issues of economic inequality and\\nunemployment, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Witnessing over 200 shopping centres being looted and\\nessential institutions like pharmacies and schools being destroyed, underscored the urgent need for change.\\n\\nOur decision to relocate to the Netherlands is not solely an escape from the turbulence endured in South Africa but also\\na gravitation towards familial bonds and a society known for its safety, welfare system, and quality of life. My\\nfather‚Äôs residence in Terneuzen and the Dutch citizenship that Lea‚Äôs mother, Linda, has resolutely maintained, anchor us\\nto the Netherlands, not just by heritage but by a shared vision for security and stability.\\n\\nThis move, inspired by a blend of necessity and deep-rooted familial ties, signifies a longing for peace and the pursuit\\nof opportunities in a land where Nico, cradled by our family's Dutch legacy, can grow unfettered by fear. It marks a\\ndeliberate stride towards a future imbued with security, communal harmony, and the nurture of the values we hold dear.\\nThe echoes of the 2021 unrest will remain a poignant reminder of our journey‚Äôs impetus, steering us toward a new chapter\\nin the Netherlands, where the promise of a brighter tomorrow awaits our family.\\n\\n## Mosa√Øek Church - A Spiritual Haven\\n\\nMosa√Øek Church has been a fundamental part of our lives, serving not only as a spiritual haven but also as a community\\nwhere we have formed lasting connections and experienced profound growth. Located in Fairland, Johannesburg, Mosa√Øek is\\nmore than just a place of worship; it's a place where our family's significant life events were embraced and celebrated,\\ndeeply entwining our journey with this vibrant community of faith.\\n\\n### A Community of Support and Growth\\n\\nUpon our return to South Africa, we found solace and a sense of belonging within the walls of Mosa√Øek Church. It was\\nhere that we engaged deeply with a community that mirrors our values of kindness, compassion, and a collective pursuit\\nof spiritual growth. Whether it was through Sunday services, community outreach initiatives, or vibrant Christmas\\ncelebrations, Mosa√Øek provided a fertile ground for us to nurture our faith and contribute to the welfare of those\\naround us.\\n\\nThe church's inclusive atmosphere and the genuine warmth of its members made it an irreplaceable part of our lives,\\nencouraging us to actively participate in its various programmes. Each sermon, each gathering, became an opportunity to\\nreflect, learn, and bond, not just as a couple but within a larger family of faith.\\n\\n### Serendipity and Spiritual Discovery\\n\\nOne particularly memorable moment was when Lea decided to light a candle at Mosa√Øek but found herself staying for an\\nunexpected service. This unplanned experience turned out to be profoundly touching, moving her to tears and deepening\\nour appreciation for the spontaneous moments of connection and reflection that Mosa√Øek Church facilitates. It\\nunderscored the church‚Äôs ability to offer spiritual solace and inspiration when least expected, making each visit\\nuniquely meaningful.\\n\\n### Psychologist Support: A Journey to Well-being\\n\\nAmong the myriad ways Mosa√Øek Church has touched our lives, one of the most personal and profound has been through the\\npsychological support services it facilitated for Lea. During a period of seeking deeper self-understanding and coping\\nmechanisms, Lea found guidance and solace under the care of a psychologist associated with Mosa√Øek. This facet of\\nMosa√Øek's community support underscores the church's comprehensive approach to nurturing not just spiritual well-being\\nbut mental health as well.\\n\\nThe church's role in facilitating this critical support for Lea was a testament to its commitment to the holistic\\nwell-being of its congregation. While specific details about the sessions remain private, the impact was deeply felt. It\\nprovided Lea with valuable insights into her mental health, encouraging personal growth and resilience. This experience\\nat Mosa√Øek was not just about spiritual nourishment; it became a sanctuary for emotional and psychological healing,\\nfurther intertwining our lives with the church.\\n\\nLooking back on this journey, the psychological support Lea received through Mosa√Øek played a crucial role in our\\nfamily's narrative. It highlighted the importance of acknowledging and addressing mental health with compassion and\\nprofessional care. Mosa√Øek's inclusive and supportive environment, exemplified by this experience, reinforced our belief\\nin the church as a pillar of unwavering support, embodying the message of love and care beyond the conventional.\\n\\n### Nico's Baptism - A Milestone Embraced\\n\\nOne of the most cherished moments at Mosa√Øek was the baptism of our beloved son, Nico. Initially fraught with\\nuncertainty due to unavoidable circumstances that prevented Dominee Vickus from conducting the baptism, Mosa√Øek stepped\\nin gracefully, facilitating a memorable ceremony that would mark an essential milestone in Nico's spiritual journey.\\nThis event, held within the iconic Klip Kerk of Mosa√Øek, was a true testament to the church's role as a pillar of\\nsupport, embodying the love and communal warmth we‚Äôve always found here.\\n\\nThe ceremony, surrounded by loved ones and our church family, not only signified Nico's initiation into the Christian\\nfaith but also celebrated the resilience and unity of our community. It was a profound reminder of the depth of our\\nconnection to Mosa√Øek and the unwavering support network it represents for our family.\\n\\n### A Foundation for Future Journeys\\n\\nAs we contemplate our upcoming move to the Netherlands, the essence of Mosa√Øek‚Äîits values, its community, and the\\nindelible moments we've shared‚Äîaccompanies us. The foundational experiences and lessons garnered here form a spiritual\\ncompass guiding us forward, as we embark on finding a new church community that reflects the warmth, inclusivity, and\\nsense of belonging we've experienced at Mosa√Øek.\\n\\nOur journey with Mosa√Øek Church encapsulates a significant chapter of our spiritual and personal growth, one that we\\ncarry forward with gratitude and hope. It will always represent a corner of our hearts dedicated to the shared faith,\\ncommunity bonds, and unique moments that have shaped us into the family we are today.\\n\\n## Challenges and Resilience\\n\\n### Health Challenges\\n\\nLea Overbeeke has navigated her life with grace despite several health challenges. Her journey encompasses not only\\nmanaging chronic conditions like Type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis but also overcoming acute medical events\\nwith significant personal impacts.\\n\\n- **Appendix Surgery**: An important event in Lea's medical history was the removal of her appendix. This surgery took\\n  place while she was in grade 10 or 11, during her schooling in South Africa, marking a significant moment in her\\n  journey of resilience and strength.\\n\\n### Emotional Resilience\\n\\n- **Fear of Driving**: Lea has a tangible fear of driving, stemming from a traumatic experience in her youth. While\\n  waiting at a red light on her scooter, she was struck by a car - an incident that has left a lasting imprint on her.\\n  This experience has infused her with a cautious perspective on driving, underscoring her resilience in facing her\\n  fears while navigating her daily life. Lea's apprehension regarding driving surfaces in conversations where she\\n  expresses an acute sense of anxiety about potential accidents.\\n\\nThese challenges, both physical and emotional, highlight the strength and resilience that Lea possesses. Her ability to\\nnavigate these obstacles, supported by the unwavering dedication of her family, especially Marjo, underscores the depth\\nof her character and the support system that uplifts her.\\n\"}, {'text': \"# Marjo Wenzel van Lier\\n\\n## Basic Information\\n\\n- **Full Name:** Marjo Wenzel van Lier\\n- **Date of Birth:** January 10, 1987\\n- **Place of Birth:** Pretoria, Tshwane, Gauteng, South Africa\\n- **Current Residence:** Veghel, North Brabant, Netherlands\\n- **Profession:** Senior Application Engineer at BAS World (as of June 2022)\\n\\n## Family Background\\n\\n- **Parents:**\\n    - **Father:** Hille Dominicus van Lier (nickname: Hildo, born August 4, 1962, in Orange Free State, South Africa)\\n    - **Mother:** Soria van Lier (n√©e van Dyk, born October 14, 1965, in Parow, Bellville, Cape Province, South Africa)\\n- **Siblings:**\\n    - **Brother:** Stiaan Cornelius van Lier (born August 2, 1988, in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, South Africa)\\n    - **Brother:** Henri Jurie van Lier (born October 31, 1990, in Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng, South Africa)\\n- **Spouse:** Cornelia Adriana Janna Overbeeke (nickname: Lea, born July 28, 1988, in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa)\\n    - **Met:** May 17, 2014, at the Jacaranda Day music festival held at SuperSport Park in Centurion, South Africa\\n    - **Started Dating:** June 6, 2014\\n    - **Engaged:** December 16, 2018, at Biru, a Chinese hotpot restaurant in Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa\\n    - **Married:** February 29, 2020, in Tarlton, Mogale, West Rand, Gauteng, South Africa\\n- **Children:**\\n    - **Son:** Nicholas (Nico) Wenzel van Lier (born September 8, 2021, in Roodepoort, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South\\n      Africa)\\n\\n## Pivotal Life Events\\n\\n- **Marriage:**\\n    - Marjo married Cornelia Adriana Janna Overbeeke (Lea) on February 29, 2020, in Tarlton, Mogale, West Rand, Gauteng,\\n      South Africa.\\n- **Birth of Son:**\\n    - Nicholas (Nico) Wenzel van Lier was born on September 8, 2021, in Roodepoort, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.\\n\\n## Personal Life & Well-being\\n\\n- Marjo Wenzel van Lier is married to Cornelia Adriana Janna Overbeeke (Lea).
